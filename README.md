# Aquarium fish feeder quantity reducer

If you own a fish feeder that looks like this:

You may need to change the only quantity reducer that is provided, depending on the kind of food you are using.

The hole is designed with a bottom larger than the top to avoid cloggins as much as possible.

Here is a file to print a whole set of them, because often you need to try and check what is best.

It prints 5 for each three differents opening values but you can change this according to your needs.
(my friend has 9 aquariums, thus many feeders, I only have one).

It's easy to change the opening measures, in case you need something still different.
